- 👋 Hi, I’m Az Zikra
- 👀 I’m interested in delving into the wonders of web development. Designing sleek interfaces, making code do the tango – it's my kind of playground
- 🌱 I'm currently on a journey to master full-stack web development using both PHP and Java technologies
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that bring together the finesse of front-end development. Imagine weaving seamless interfaces, creating digital experiences that leave users in awe – that's the sweet spot I'm aiming for!
- 📫 How to reach me? Feel free to connect through my GitHub or email me at azzikra.ismunandar08@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm so meticulous in my coding that even my cat has started using semicolons in its meows. Now, debugging its purrformance issues has become my new favorite hobby! 🐱💻
